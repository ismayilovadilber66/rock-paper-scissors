About the Project

This project is a basic implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, designed to enhance familiarity with:

JavaScript fundamentals such as functions, conditionals, and event handling.

DOM manipulation to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.

LocalStorage API to save the game state or player scores across sessions.

The game is beginner-friendly and an excellent starting point for understanding interactive web applications.

Features

Simple and intuitive user interface.

Real-time feedback on player and computer choices.

Keeps track of the player’s score using the browser's LocalStorage.

Randomized computer choices to ensure fair gameplay.

Technologies Used

HTML5: Structure of the web page.

CSS3: Styling and layout design, including responsive features.

JavaScript: Game logic, DOM manipulation, and LocalStorage integration.

How It Works

User Input: The player selects one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

Computer Choice: The computer’s choice is randomly generated.

Comparison: The player’s choice is compared with the computer’s to determine the winner based on the following rules:

Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beats Paper

Paper beats Rock

Scoring: The player's score is updated and saved in LocalStorage.

Feedback: The game provides immediate feedback on the result of each round.

Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Open the index.html File:
Open the file in your preferred web browser to start the game.

No additional installations or dependencies are required.

Usage

Open the game in your web browser.

Click on your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

View the result of the round and your updated score.

Refresh the page to reset the game if needed (note: score will persist due to LocalStorage).

Future Improvements

Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

Add a reset button to clear the score and restart the game.

Introduce additional themes and sound effects for a more engaging experience.

Implement a two-player mode for local multiplayer gameplay.

Expand the game with more choices like "Lizard" and "Spock" to include variations like "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock."

Add animations to enhance the user interface.

Enjoy playing and feel free to contribute to its development!
